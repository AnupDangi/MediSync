so use the website http://127.0.0.1:5001/test to check the server running or not 
then during testing of the ml model in postman , you have to create a request and then give the link http://127.0.0.1:5001/predict_risk with the body raw and json snippet like:{
    "drug_a": "Ibuprofen",
    "drug_b": "Aspirin"
} 
and ur expected output will be :
{
    "interaction_info": {
        "alternatives": "Acetaminophen",
        "interaction_type": "Increased bleeding risk",
        "side_effects": "Nausea, stomach pain"
    },
    "risk_level": "High"
}
just run this using python checker.py 
and this happens in a virtual environment
